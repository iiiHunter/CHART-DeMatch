# CHART-DeMatch
CHART-DeMatch is a framework of chart panel analysis(CPA). The CPA task contains two subtasks: axis analysis and legend analysis.

**Axis Analysis:** The axis analysis system is expected to output the location of  tick  mark  and  associated  corresponding  value  text  on  both  the  X-axis  andY-axis. 

**Legend Analysis:** In a chart, each legend mark is associated with a dataseries name. For the understanding of chart with multiple data series, it is criticalto analyze the legend first. The legend analysis system is responsible for finding all the legend marks area, and link them to the associated label text.

The code will be released soon.
